In this project, a digital synthesizer was designed and implemented, consisting of two main parts: synthesis and an effect rack. In the synthesis section, various oscillators with sine, square, sawtooth, and triangular waveforms were implemented, along with envelopes to control the dynamic behavior of the signal over time. In the effect section, a range of audio effects, including saturation, compression, delay, phaser, flanger, chorus, reverberation, and voltage-controlled filters, were added in sequence to modify the final output. Additionally, features like pitch shifting and a vocoder were also implemented.
